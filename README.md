# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, I build a machine learning model to decide if the loan will be approved or not. 

## Study the models

I created and compared two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. I fit, and score the models to make a prediction to which model you will perform better. 

## LogisticRegression model

the results that I got for the logistic regression after fitting the model into the data and printing the score:

- Training Data Score: 0.9921240885954051
- Testing Data Score: 0.9918489475856377

## Random Forests Classifier model

the results that I got for the random forests classifier after fitting the model into the data and printing the score:

- Training Data Score random forests classifier: 0.9975409272252029
- Testing Data Score random forests classifier: 0.991642591828312

## Prediction

Both model performed fine but from the scores results we can see that Random forests classifier model perform a little better than the Logistic regression model since the training score for the random forests classifier "0.9975409272252029" is higher than the training score for the Logistic one "0.9921240885954051"
